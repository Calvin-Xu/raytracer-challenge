# raytracer-challenge
A Typed Racket implementation of the ray tracer described in [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com) by Jamis Buck.

![Cornell Box](https://github.com/Calvin-Xu/raytracer-challenge/raw/main/gallery/cornellbox.png)

Unoptimized and very slow; currently has features of up to chapter 11 of the book and additionally:

* multithreaded rendering
* focal blur

Source code is tangled from the (not very) literate [raytracer-challenge.org](https://github.com/Calvin-Xu/raytracer-challenge/blob/main/raytracer-challenge.org) document.
